## Instructions
Once you have followed the Mozilla tutorial and created your Environment, everytime you want to start working again, open cmd on the folder, then you need to do `workon yourEnvName`
Next, you need to `cd DjangoATM`
Lastly, run this to start the server and see the app's current state `python manage.py runserver`

I am using VSCode to edit the .py and .html etc files.
